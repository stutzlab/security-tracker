This project uses gulp for building tasks.

In order to start building this project, perform "npm install" on this directory and then "./gulp".
This will install gulp and nodemcu-tool to local node_modules repository (global repo doesn't work) and try to upload lua files to nodemcu.
If you need to change serial port parameters, edit the ".nodemcu-tool" file.
To change gulp build, edit "gulpfile.js"
